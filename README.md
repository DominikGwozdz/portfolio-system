###Portfolio System made from scratch by Dominik Gwozdz in CakePHP 3.8

####Getting started
1. Run ```composer install```
2. Import database from ```db-sample -> import.sql```
3. Set configuration for connection Database in app.php
4. Set Apache2 / Nginx virtual host ```webroot``` as root directory
5. Configure Apache2 virtualhost as ```AllowOverride yes``` for htaccess needs
6. Run ```/panel``` root if you want to see panel admin
7. If you want to set privileges for ```/panel``` root, then do this by apache2 authorization

####This project is my first non commercial project and did by my own "hands". You can create your own gallery, portfolio photographer system.
